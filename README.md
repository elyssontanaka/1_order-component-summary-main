## My process

### Built with

- CSS variables
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my very first challenge on Front End Mentor. Gained more confidence building simple html and css from scratch. I learned how to position the image as a background and how to position the elements on the screen the way I found more appropriate. I'm always trying to write better code and learn better ways to do the same thing and achieve the expected outcome.
